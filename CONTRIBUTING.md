# Contributing to Markable

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to contribute?

You can check [TASKS.TODO](https://github.com/hbhde/markable/blob/master/TASKS.TODO.md), and complete some of them. You can also find more tasks to do or simply report solid bugs for us to fix.

## How to report a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/hbhde/markable/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/hbhde/markable/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## How to add a new feature or change an existing one

*Before making any significant changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hbhde/markable/issues).* Discussing your proposed changes ahead of time will make the contribution process smooth for everyone.

Once we've discussed your changes and you've got your code ready, make sure that tests are passing and open your pull request. Your PR is most likely to be accepted if it:

- Update the README.md if nessessary.
- Includes tests for new functionality.
- References the original issue in description if relevant, e.g. "Resolves #1".
- Has a [good commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
