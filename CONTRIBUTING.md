# Contributing

## Issues

New issues are welcome, whether questions or suggestions or reporting bugs. You are also welcome to contribute by adding helpful comments on an existing issue.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests will be considered. Please submit pull requests against the develop branch.

Follow the existing code style. Check the tests succeed. Run the build.

* `npm test`
* `npm run build`

Don't update the CHANGELOG or command version number. That gets done by maintainers when preparing the release.

Your commits should have a [good commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Useful things to include in your request description are:

- what problem are you solving?
- what Issues does this relate to?
- suggested summary for CHANGELOG

There are a lot of forms of documentation which could need updating for a change in functionality. It is ok if you want to show us the code to discuss before doing the extra work, and you should say so in your comments so we focus on the concept first before talking about all the other pieces:

- README
- tests
